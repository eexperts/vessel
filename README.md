**Vessel** uses [Laradock](https://github.com/laradock/laradock) as a submodule in order to keep its version up to version with what in the air.

**Vessel** covers as well project building scripts, each project must have a build script that handle the infrastructure initiation.

## How to use

    - Give permission to **www** folder by running `chmod +x /var/www` inside the **workspace** container.
